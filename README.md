# The aperiodic monotile in a variety of formats

This repository contains code and vector image files to produce [the aperiodic monotiles found by David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/).

There's a family of related shapes, each made of 14 edges (though two of the edges are parallel and adjacent so look like a single long edge).
Each edge is one of two lengths, ùëé or ùëè. The angles in the shape don't change.
There is [an interactive tool](https://somethingorotherwhatever.com/aperiodic-monotile/interactive.html) to draw the tiles with any choice of the parameters and download in SVG or PNG format.

There are three interesting monotiles, which each tile the plane aperiodically.

A 'hat':

A 'turtle':

And a 'spectre':

Each file produces a single copy of the tile. Several copies of the tile fit together to tile the plane:

* The 'hat' monotile can tile the plane together with its reflection.
* The 'turtle' monotile can also tile the plane with its reflection. (It and the hat are two of a family of polygons that tile the plane in the same way.)
* The 'spectre' monotile, with curved edges, can tile the plane _only_ without its reflection. (The spectre with straight edges is related to both the hat and turtle, but it can tile the plane periodically _and_ aperiodically. An aperiodic tiling can be forced by forbidding reflections‚Äîwhich is effectively what curving the edges accomplishes.)
